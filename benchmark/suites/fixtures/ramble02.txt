meeting notes from today - Sarah said we should focus on the mobile app first but then Jake disagreed and thought desktop was more important because that's where our current users are and also we need to fix that bug in the checkout process that people keep complaining about on twitter - speaking of twitter we should probably respond to those complaints soon maybe this week - anyway back to the product roadmap Sarah wants to launch by Q2 but that seems really aggressive given we still don't have designs finalized and the backend team is already overloaded with the database migration - oh and remind me to follow up with the design team about the color scheme because the purple they chose doesn't meet accessibility standards we need better contrast - also need to schedule a meeting with legal about the privacy policy updates before we can launch in EU - Jake mentioned hiring two more engineers but HR said budget is frozen until next quarter - priority list I think is: 1) fix checkout bug 2) finish designs 3) backend work 4) then maybe we can talk about launch date? - also someone should update the stakeholder deck for the board meeting next month
