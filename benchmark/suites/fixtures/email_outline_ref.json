I lost several days of work time and am concerned I cannot complete the assignment to the expected standard by the original deadline.\n\nWould it be possible to submit the assignment by Monday, [date] instead? This would give me the weekend to complete the work properly.\n\nI understand this may cause inconvenience and I apologize for the short notice. Thank you for considering my request.\n\nBest regards,\n[Name]"
