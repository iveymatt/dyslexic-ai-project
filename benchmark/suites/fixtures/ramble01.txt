ok so i was thinking about the wild kratts episode we watched and how cool it was that the octopus can change colors and also it reminded me that i need to email my teacher about the project and oh yeah the project is due on friday and i still need to finish the research part about camouflage in animals and also get pictures but mom said we can go to the library on thursday... speaking of library i need to return those books about marine biology they're due tomorrow or maybe wednesday i forget... anyway back to the octopus thing they can also change their texture not just color which is wild and i want to include that in my project with the chameleon stuff too because both animals use camouflage but in different ways and that's the whole point of the project comparing them... also need to remember to bring my lunch tomorrow because i forgot it today and had to buy pizza which was ok but expensive and mom said i need to be more responsible... oh and for the project i should probably make it visual with pictures and maybe a diagram showing how chromatophores work that would be cool and ms. johnson said we could do a poster or a presentation i think poster would be easier because i'm not good at talking in front of the class... need to check if we have poster board at home or if i need to ask mom to get some when we go to target this weekend... also that reminds me i wanted to get new markers because mine are all dried out... for the project outline i think i'll do intro about camouflage then section on octopuses with the color AND texture changing then chameleons with just color changing then compare and contrast section then conclusion about why camouflage is important for survival... yeah that sounds good i should write that down before i forget
