## Our Philosophy

> "Neurodivergent brains aren't broken. They just work differently. Stop trying to 'fix' us. Start building tools that work WITH how we think."

We believe:
- Dyslexia is a language-processing difference, not a disability
- Lateral thinking (connections, exploration) is just as valid as linear thinking
- ADHD brains need both structure AND flexibility
- Autistic communication styles are valid and valuable
- Masking is exhausting and shouldn't be required
- AI tools should adapt to US, not the other way around
